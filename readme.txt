IMPORTANT CONCEPTS OF THIS TOPIC:

1. First we create Sequelize class & to establish connection with the database(mysql2 etc) we need object of this class.

2. Then we create an object of this class, or new instance.

3. Sequelize is inherently designed to work with Promises and async/await.

4. When we define models we use the same sequequelize object so it knows the models and relations and can translate them to actual tables using sync method.
